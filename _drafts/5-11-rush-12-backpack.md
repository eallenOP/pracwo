Have had this bag a couple of years now. It's been in boats, on hikes in the bush and all sorts of adventures. It's been soaked in salt water and cleaned off again several times, and not much can survive that.

It's comfortable to carry, even with a full load. It can carry just about enough for a lightweight overnighter. I've added a bottle holder and a first aid pouch to the sides, although this does make things a bit wide it's certainly convenient to be able to do. Same goes with adding an admin pouch on the front. Just the right configuration of pockets makes organising gear really easy. Lighter loads often just use pockets, with nothing in the main bag, which is a bit odd. Good thing it has compression straps.

It can be a bit hard to get into at times due to having to get the zip past molle on the rain guard and past flapping compression straps and pouches. The quick access pockets are easy though, and get used a lot. The stretchy pocket inside the main compartment lost one end of the bungy - it came free from the anchor point and snuck out the hole at centre. I sewed it back in.

Overall a very usable bag!
