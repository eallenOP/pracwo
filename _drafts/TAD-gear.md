## General Purpose Pouch 1
General purpose = multi purpose

I once searched in vain for the ultimate admin pouch. I bought and tried several after reading dozens of reviews and product descriptions. But when I bought the GPP1 I realised that the ultimate admin pouch is too specialised to be properly useful. With the GPP1, the beauty is in the versatility. It can be an admin pouch and carry notebook, pen, knife, torch, tape, cord and lighter. Or it can just as easily and effectively be a med pouch, a headphone pouch, a snack pouch, a tech and cable pouch. It's not so big that attaching to to PALS webbing ends up looking like an odd growth on your bag, nor is it so small that you can't, say, shove a pair of work gloves in there if you need to. I think I'll stop searching for the ultimate admin pouch.

## Topo Shemagh
Work, play, adventure

The topo skull shemagh is the softest, most stylish shemagh I have found. Then again, my others are mostly cheap ones from the surplus store. I really like that the design is subtle but even if you can't see the central image most people who are familiar with the outdoors will recognise the topo lines pattern. I got a darkish colour so I can wear it to work, out on a cool evening or adventuring in hot or cold weather. I think I'll probably get a second one!

## FAST Pack Scout
Quick Scout story of the day

This one's just a quick story of today's Scout pack adventure. I'll do a full review of this bag at some point.

A day off work means a better dog walk day. Today was a calm, mild and slightly rainy day, so the best Buddy and I headed off around the bays knowing we would have the place mostly to ourselves. He enjoys the smells, I enjoy the views. The Scout pack enjoys carrying my stuff: EDC items just stay in the front pocket plus I had a small tool kit in there from a previous outing. First aid kit, water bottle, snack, Buff, gloves, responsible-dog-owner bags, treats. The hound was happy to get the longer walk and I was happy to carry whatever I probably wouldn't need. There was space for the rain shell in there too, and I just about could have taken it off (but didn't).
