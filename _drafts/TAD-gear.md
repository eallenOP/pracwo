## General Purpose Pouch 1
General purpose = multi purpose

I once searched in vain for the ultimate admin pouch. I bought and tried several after reading dozens of reviews and product descriptions. But when I bought the GPP1 I realised that the ultimate admin pouch is too specialised to be properly useful. With the GPP1, the beauty is in the versatility. It can be an admin pouch and carry notebook, pen, knife, torch, tape, cord and lighter. Or it can just as easily and effectively be a med pouch, a headphone pouch, a snack pouch, a tech and cable pouch. It's not so big that attaching to to PALS webbing ends up looking like an odd growth on your bag, nor is it so small that you can't, say, shove a pair of work gloves in there if you need to. I think I'll stop searching for the ultimate admin pouch.
