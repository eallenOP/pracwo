Every Day Carry is a huge thing these days. It's very easy to get led down the rabbit hole and start feeling like you don't have enough proper pens, waterproof notebooks, knives, torches, minimalist wallets, pry bars and multi tools. EDC can become a fantastic geek-out subject, and there are heaps of forums, websites and blogs to keep you busy.

But the other side of EDC is the reality. There really are some things we carry every day that actually come in handy and are nice to carry.

So rather than doing a pocket dump on [Everydaycarry.com](https://everydaycarry.com) I thought I would just write a post about what I carry every day. Not counting all the geeky stuff I would like to carry every day, just the real stuff. And hey! Photos! Sorry, I should do more photos.
