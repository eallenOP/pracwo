This bag is a really good configuration for an emergency getaway bag (bug out bag). It's a perfect size at 30L, and has just the right amount of organisation. The top pocket is great for stashing tools, gloves can squeeze into the front mesh pocket and each side pocket is plenty big enough to fit a 1.5L PET bottle with some room to spare. The pocket on the bottom is the ideal spot to stash some warm layers so that they're easy to get to without having to remove them from the main compartment to access other equipment.

It's not a five-star bag though. The webbing on the bag is quite narrow, especially on the straps. I have reinforced where the straps meet the bag. The zips are beefy, but aren't YKK and the tabs make a bit of noise unless you loop them with cordage. For this size of bag, it would be useful to have a waist belt for stability, and it could definitely use load lifters to bring the heavy stuff at the top close to your back. The straps themselves are nearly comfortable under load and the grab handle is usable but could be slightly wider from end to end.
