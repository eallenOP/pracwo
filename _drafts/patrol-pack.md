This bag is a really good configuration for an emergency getaway bag (bug out bag). It's a perfect size at 30L, and has just the right amount of organisation. The top pocket is great for stashing tools, gloves can squeeze into the front mesh pocket and each side pocket is plenty big enough to fit a 1.5L PET bottle with some room to spare. The pocket on the bottom is the ideal spot to stash some warm layers so that they're easy to get to without having to remove them from the main compartment to access other equipment.
