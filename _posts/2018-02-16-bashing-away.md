One thing for me that has to be included in being a practical woman is the ability to use a computer. So I thought it might be nice to write some posts about my escapades in IT.

I'm a dabbler. I like to dabble. One of the dabblings that gets a lot of my attention at the moment is web development with Jekyll. So today I decided to make an actual blog with Jekyll, and have finally managed to start writing words instead of bash commands.

My biggest face-palm moment (it's Friday, ok?) was forgetting that I've updated my OS since I last used Jekyll and needed to reinstall command line tools. If this happens to you, you might not know what to do either because you get all sorts of odd and unrelated error messages and stackoverflow is not forthcoming. This has now happened to me twice, and I forgot today what I did last time, so went through the Google Gauntlet all over again.

Anyway, job done. 

The other thing I'm thinking about is solidifying my online presence into this consistent entity: Ek. Right now I have a GitHub account for work, which has my work-self all over it, and I'd quite like to leave that for just work stuff and do all my dabbling as Ek. Heck, I don't even know who I'm committing as right now!
