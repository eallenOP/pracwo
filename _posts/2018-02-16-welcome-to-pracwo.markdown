Welcome to The Practical Woman Blog!

This is not a blog exclusively for women, but is written by a practical woman. Why? There are plenty of blogs out there with practical subjects, like travel, outdoor activities, survival prepping, EDC. I know, because I like to read them. But so much of the material on those blogs is written by or for men or, in some cases, by women who might not think it feminine to be practical. 

So who is this blog for? It's for anyoneâ€”that's what sets it apart. 

One more thing to note: this blog is not Amerocentric or Eurocentric. In fact, it's written from the Southern Hemisphere. So it will hopefully be, for all intents and purposes, as international as possible.

You might be reading this shortly after it's been written, in which case there isn't much more to read just yet, but if you're reading retrospectively then I hope you enjoy the blog!
