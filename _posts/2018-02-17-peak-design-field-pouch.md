I recently purchased the [Field Pouch](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/bags/field-pouch/) by Peak Design to use as a camera or accessory bag for my OM-D EM-10 mirrorless camera. Oddly enough, I haven't used it as much as I thought I would... until last week.

As a camera bag, I would flag this one for occasional use. My OM-D fits in with a small lens, but the bag is pretty lumpy when closed. Also, I only have the one [Peak Slide Lite strap](https://www.peakdesign.com/slide-lite) so would have another strap on the camera. I did also buy the [Clutch](https://www.peakdesign.com/product/straps/clutch), which works well in this overall set-up.

For accessory carry (with the camera on the Slide strap and the pouch on a belt, or similar) the Field Pouch works well. I carry a lens or two and a spare battery, plus maybe some standard EDC items in this set-up.

The Field Pouch has really come into its own recently though, on a conference trip to Sydney. I litterally only took it off at night when back at my hotel. 

On the plane the pouch (plus Slide) served as my "personal item" in addition to my carry-on, which was my only other luggage. Because of its size, I wore it while sitting in my seat and had everything I needed close to hand, while the rest of my luggage was stowed overhead. Bording passes, passport, money, cards... I'll update this post later with full packing list and pictures. 

Normally I would want to minimise bag-juggle by putting important stuff in pockets about my person, but this pouch was no juggling ball. Wearing it cross-body with the strap quite short meant it didn't swing or get in the way. It pretty much just tucked under my arm and I barely noticed it was there.

Around the city and at the conference I wore it all the time. Notebook and pen lived in there, and came out frequently. The velcro wasn't too loud to open during a talk. I even used it as a kind of desk to lean my notebook on. 

The Field Pouch acted as my wallet when wandering around the city. With cards and cash tucked in the front zippered pocket I felt totally secure from any pick-pocketing as that pocket is so well concealed. My load-out was half travel stuff and half EDC items, and the size of the pouch meant I didn't pack too much. Because of this, I frequently forgot I was carrying a bag. Until I needed something, and had everything right there and easy to get out.

I got rained on quite a lot, and nothing inside the pouch was in the slightest bit damp at the end of the day. I even got a compliment from a lady at the airport bookshop: "That's a great little travel bag!". Looks-wise, I felt like I was carrying a designer handbag without the impractical feminine aspects that usually entails. It went well with everything I wore and was equally at home in the business environment of the conference or at a bar in the evening.

All in all, I'm extreely happy with this little pouch. I'm still not too likely to use it as much in my home town as I don't carry as much and spend lots of time near home, car or office. But every time I go away I know this bag will shine.
