A short bragging post. I don't know why I hadn't done this earlier, but I guess it's because if you google how to implement tags with Jekyll blogs you normally get advice to create tag pages - one page for each list of posts associated with a single tag. Don't do that! Just use Liquid to pop all your tag-based post lists on one page. Then you can add anchors to send the reader down the page to the right tag.
