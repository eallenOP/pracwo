This bag is a really good configuration for an emergency getaway bag (bug out bag). It's a perfect size at 30L, and has just the right amount of organisation. It's not the perfect backpack though, and there are some aspects of this bag that might indicate that it was built on a tight budget.

*A good size with plenty of exterior access*

Firstly, the layout of the bag and its pockets is useful for packing emergency equipment. The bag has a large main compartment with a tuck pocket at the back, two generous side pockets with dual zips, one pretty small front mesh pocket with no dimension and one large stash pocket on the top lid. There is also a secondary compartment on the bottom of the pack, with dual zips. The closure of the main compartment is by drawstring, with a buckled flap over the top like a traditional rucksack.

The exterior pockets on the bag make storage and retrieval of frequently used items fast and easy. The top pocket is great for stashing tools, though heavy items could make the flap sag to the front a bit.

*Front pocket with gloves*

Although it's a tight space, gloves can squeeze into the front mesh pocket for quick retrieval. Each side pocket is plenty big enough to fit a 1.5L PET bottle with some room to spare.

The pocket on the bottom is the ideal spot to stash some warm layers so that they're easy to get to without having to remove them from the main compartment to access other equipment. It would also be a good place to store wet or dirty gear away from the rest of your stuff.

*Bottom pocket big enough for a rain coat, socks and a thermal undershirt*

It's not a five-star bag though. The webbing on the bag is quite narrow, especially on the straps. I have reinforced where the straps meet the bag.

The zips are beefy, but aren't YKK and the tabs make a bit of noise unless you loop them with cordage. I'd do this anyway because it makes them more visible and easier to grab, especially when wearing gloves.

For this size of bag, it would be useful to have a waist belt for stability, and it could definitely use load lifters to bring the heavy stuff at the top close to your back. The straps themselves are nearly comfortable under load and the grab handle is usable but could be slightly wider from end to end.

Overall, although it's not the most comfortable carry nor probably the toughest bag in the world, this is a great bag for a getaway kit because it's cheap to buy, holds enough gear without overdoing it and has just the right amount of organisation and external access.
